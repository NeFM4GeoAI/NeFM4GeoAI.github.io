## Important Dates

* **2025-08-xx**: Tutorial at KDD 2025 (Half-day session)
* **Venue**: To be announced

## Tutorial Outline

The tutorial will be organized as follows, with a 10-minute break:

* Introduction & Motivation (35 minutes)
    * An overview of Euclidean foundation models
    * Brief introduction to hyperbolic geometry and Riemannian manifolds
    * Motivation for incorporating hyperbolic geometry into foundation models
* Hyperbolic Neural Networks as Building Blocks (40 min)
    * Hyperbolic neural network operations
    * Hyperbolic neural network models
* Hyperbolic Foundation Models (60 minutes)
    * Hyperbolic Transformers and LLMs
    * Hyperbolic vision foundation models
    * Hyperbolic multi-modal models
* Future Directions and Challenges (35 Minutes)
    * Hyperbolic pre-trained models
    * Advanced hyperbolic foundation models
    * Hyperbolic deep learning tools and libraries


## Target Audience and Prerequisite

This tutorial targets machine learning researchers of any background, particularly those interested in foundation models, non-Euclidean, and geometric deep learning. We explore advanced applications of hyperbolic geometry in these fields, focusing on large-scale hyperbolic models that extend beyond the concepts covered in previous tutorials.
No special background in differential geometry is required, though familiarity with mathematical concepts such as Riemannian manifolds would be helpful.
