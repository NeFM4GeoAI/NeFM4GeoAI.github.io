The primary objective of the NEGL workshop at [WebConf 2025](https://www2025.thewebconf.org/) is to create a collaborative platform for researchers, industry professionals, and academics from diverse fields. These include non-Euclidean representation learning, geometric deep learning, and large foundation models, as well as web-related applications such as recommender systems, social network analysis, web knowledge graphs, search systems, information retrieval, and multi-modal web content understanding. The workshop aims to foster knowledge sharing, idea exchange, and discussions on the latest advancements and challenges in these domains.

## Call for Papers

We welcome submissions on the following topics (but not limited to):

- **Theoretical Foundations**: Explore the principles underlying non-Euclidean and geometric representation learning, focusing on properties such as curvature, geodesics, and isometries, and their influence on foundation model performance.

- **Architectures, Algorithms, and Large Foundation Models**: Develop novel architectures and algorithms integrating large foundation models (e.g., LLMs, ViTs, and multi-modal models) with non-Euclidean spaces and geometric principles, enhancing their capability to handle complex structures and relationships.

- **Adapting and Enhancing Existing Foundation Models**: Investigate approaches for fine-tuning, continual learning, and adapting existing foundation models to new tasks and domains. This includes integrating advanced techniques such as **GraphRAG** (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for knowledge-driven applications, and enabling agent-like capabilities for interactive and adaptive problem-solving in non-Euclidean.

- **Geometric Deep Learning**: Advance methods in geometric learning, including **graph neural networks**, **equivariant models, and message-passing framework**s, with applications to web-specific tasks like structured data representation and multi-modal alignment.

- **Web Applications and Case Studies**: Highlight applications in web domains, including **social networks, knowledge graphs, search systems, recommender systems, and multi-modal content understanding**.

- **Trustworthiness and Robustness**: Tackle challenges of fairness, interpretability, adversarial robustness, and privacy in non-Euclidean and geometric models, especially for user-facing web applications.

- **Benchmarks and Evaluation**: Propose new datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation protocols, emphasizing scalability and real-world performance on non-Euclidean and geometric models.
