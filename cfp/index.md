The primary objective of the NEGEL workshop at [WebConf 2025](https://www2025.thewebconf.org/) is to create a collaborative platform for researchers, industry professionals, and academics from diverse fields. These include non-Euclidean representation learning, geometric deep learning, and large foundation models, as well as web-related applications such as recommender systems, social network analysis, web knowledge graphs, search systems, information retrieval, and multi-modal web content understanding. The workshop aims to foster knowledge sharing, idea exchange, and discussions on the latest advancements and challenges in these domains.

We encourage in-person participation, but remote presentation will be available for authors who cannot travel to Sydney.


## Topics and Scope

#### (1) Theoretical Foundations
- Investigating generalization error, trainability, representation precision, and curvature-dimension tradeoff in non-Euclidean and geometric models.
- Contributions analyzing properties such as curvature, geodesics, isometries, and their effects on the performance of foundation models.
- Studies on expressive power of non-Euclidean and geometric representation.

#### (2) Architectures, Algorithms, and Large Foundation Models (including LLMs, ViTs, and multi-modal models)
- Development of novel architectures and algorithms integrating foundation models with non-Euclidean geometries, mixed-curvature spaces, and geometric principles.
- Adapting LLMs, ViTs, and multi-modal models to operate within non-Euclidean or geometric settings.
- Creation of new foundation models specifically tailored for non-Euclidean and geometric spaces.
- Combining non-Euclidean architectures, such as hyperbolic, spherical, mixed-curvature models, and graph neural networks, with foundation models.
- Applications of these models to web-related tasks such as search, recommendation, content understanding, and topology-aware data processing.

#### (3) Adapting and Enhancing Existing Foundation Models
- Fine-tuning, continual learning, and adaptation of existing foundation models for specific tasks in non-Euclidean and geometric contexts.
- Leveraging advanced frameworks like **GraphRAG** (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to improve knowledge-driven applications.
- Enabling agent-like capabilities for interactive, adaptive problem-solving and real-time decision-making in complex geometric and non-Euclidean spaces.
- Integration of graph-based reasoning and domain-specific geometric representations into existing foundation models.

#### (4) Geometric Deep Learning
- Advances in geometric learning frameworks, including graph neural networks, message-passing networks, and equivariant models.
- Applications of geometric deep learning to social networks, graphs, multi-modal data, and structured representations.
- Exploration of geometric biases in learning algorithms to improve scalability, efficiency, and interpretability.
- Case studies demonstrating the use of geometric deep learning in domains such as content understanding, recommendations, and real-time analytics.

#### (5) Web Applications and Case Studies
- Applications of non-Euclidean and geometric methods in social network analysis, web knowledge graphs, search systems, recommender systems, and multi-modal content understanding.
- Real-world demonstrations highlighting improved performance and scalability in web-specific tasks through geometric and non-Euclidean representations.

#### (6) Trustworthiness and Robustness
- Addressing fairness, interpretability, privacy, and adversarial robustness in geometric and non-Euclidean learning systems.
- Specific challenges and solutions for trustworthiness in user-facing web applications and sensitive data processing.

#### (7) Benchmarks and Evaluation
- Development of NEGEL-related datasets, evaluation protocols, and benchmarking tools for geometric and non-Euclidean models.
- Metrics for assessing real-world performance, scalability, and efficiency.



## Submission Guidelines

We invite submissions between **4 and 8 pages** (excluding references) covering the above topics. Manuscripts will be reviewed by our program committee through a **single-blind review process**, meaning that authors' names do not need to be anonymized. Accepted submissions will be presented either as oral talks or posters during the workshop.

For unpublished work, authors have the option to include their accepted papers in the **Companion Proceedings of the Web Conference 2025**, provided they meet the camera-ready timeline. Including a paper in the companion proceedings does **not** restrict future submissions to other venues. Previously published work is also welcome for submission to the workshop, but such work will **not** be included in the companion proceedings. 

This policy encourages open discussions while respecting the integrity of prior and future publications.

**Accepted papers will be presented as posters, with selected papers highlighted for oral presentations and outstanding paper awards.**

### Paper Format

All submissions must be in English and must adhere to the [ACM template and format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) (also [available](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty) in Overleaf), with the following options:

```latex
\setcopyright{none}
```

CCS class and keywords sections are optional.

- Papers must be between **4 and 8 pages** in the ACM manuscript format (excluding references).  
- Appendices are allowed but will not count toward the page limit. References and acknowledgements are excluded from the page count.
